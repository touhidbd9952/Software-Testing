Database Assertion is used To check that we are getting correct result from database query or not


Step 1:

Test Plan
 |---Thread Group (Users)
	|---JDBC Connection Configuration (config)
	|---Sampler (request): JDBC Request
	|		|---Assertions: Response Assertion
	|---Listener: View Results Tree, View Results in Table, Assertion Result



JDBC Connection Configuration
---------------------------------
	Database URL : jdbc:mysql://db4free.net:3306/automationbd
	JDBC Driver class:  com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
	Usrname: root
	Password: ******

JDBC Request
---------------------------------
	Name: JDBC Request
	Variable Name: test
	Query Type: Select Statement
	Query: select * from Student


Response Assertion	
---------------------------------
	Name: Response Assertion
	Apply to: Main sample only
	Response Field to Test: Text Response
	Pattern Matching Rules: Contains

	Patterns to Test: click on "Add" button and type "New Zealand" in Patterns to Test input box


Step 2: Run Test and Check the result

How to check data by database column wise?


Step 1: open "JDBC Request" and type below way column number (eg. if we have 4 column in student table then )
	
	Variable names: Col1,Col2,Col3,Col4

Step 2: open "Response Assertion"

	Apply to : JMeter Variable (select it) and type "Col4_2"       //checking "Column 4 and Row 2 have New Zealand or not"
	Patterns to Test: New Zealand

Step 3: Run Test and Check the result
